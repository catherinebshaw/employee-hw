# Employee-Directory


## Description

An application that provides searchable data on employees within an organization. 

## User Experience

Upon opening the application, users are presented with a complete listing of employees within the organization.  Data presented for each employee includes name, image, country, and cell phone number. Users can sort employees by first name in both ascending and descending order. Users can also filter employees by country.  Search results provides a summary of employees in that country.

## Technology Used 

The employee-directory was created using ReactJS and applies HTML, css, JavaScript, node.js. Employee information is obtained through an API to randomuser.me which can be updated to interface with employee databases. The application has been deployed on heroku so users are able to simply launch the application in their browser. 

## Commit History

Issues with heroku deployment required a repository rebuild. Complete commit history can be found at the link below.
